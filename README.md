# Code Labs Academy - React Native Basics Workshop

**üë®‚Äçüíª This repository serves as a support for the youtube video on the [React Native Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnNxpnOpcpM&t=1s) Workshop**

## About this workshop

React Native is a JavaScript framework for building mobile applications for both iOS and Android, based on React. In other words, web developers can now write mobile applications that look and feel truly ‚Äúnative‚Äù by leveraging JavaScript libraries that they are already comfortable with.

Plus, because most of the code you write can be shared between platforms, React Native makes it easy to simultaneously develop for both Android and iOS.

In this workshop, you will learn about React Native by building a simple application. We will start by introducing the general structure of a React Native project and building components that are visually and functionally appealing.

By the end of this workshop, you will have a good grasp of the fundamentals and be up to speed working on your own React Native applications!

Check the official documentation of React Native from [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).
